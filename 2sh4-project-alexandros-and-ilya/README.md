The FINAL PROJECT in COMPENG 2SH4, was to create the game "Snake" in C++
This project was completed with a partner named Ilya (as the file name would imply)
Ilya did the game board logic and user imput logic.I did the logic implementation (ie snake collision detection, snake death, game end conditions), and debugging.
