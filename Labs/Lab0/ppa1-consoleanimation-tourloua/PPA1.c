// MAIN PROGRAM
// ===============================
// This is the "Program Loop" as described in the PPA1 flow chart.  Read Lab Documents to visualize how a persisting program works under the hood.
// Typically, when you use some sort of "Software Design Engine", this part is scaffolded - you will only be responsible of scripting the functions.
//
// In future PPA's and Projects, you are expected to be able to set up a program loop like this from scratch whenever a persisting program is required.

// INITIALIZATION ROUTINE
// ===============================
// This routine is run only once before the start of the program loop - aka Start-Up Routine.
// You would typically do the following in this function:
//  1. Initialize global variables
//  2. Allocated memories for dynamic variables (we will talk about this after midterm)
//  3. Call the relevant initialization functions to enable certain library supports.

}




// INPUT COLLECTION ROUTINE - "Observe"
// ===============================
// In our program loop setup, we always try to first determine whether there is any incoming input.
// This routine can either be "blocking" (synchronous input) or "non-blocking" (asynchronous input)
//  Synchronous Input - The program will halt at the function call for collecting input.  It will only progress after receiving an input.
//                      This is why we call it "blocking", because synchronous input collection mode BLOCKS program progression.
//                      We use this mode of input collection when the subsequent program execution behaviour depends on the user input:
//                      Real-Life Example:  Vending Machine won't know what to vend until you press a key to make a selection.  
//                                          It won't automatically joggle drinks in front of you to confuse you before you made your choice. (LOL)
//                                          Therefore, Vending Machine operates on Synchronous Input mode - one action per command (conceptually)
//  Asynchronous Input - The program will move on to the next execution sequence if it sees no input to process.  It will never stop to wait for input.
//                       This is why we call it "non-blocking", because asynchronous input collection mode NEVER BLOCKS program progresion.
//                       We use this mode of input collection when the program execution doesn't necessarily depend on the input; instead, the input
//                       only changes the course of program progression.
//                       Real-Life Example:  Youtube Music will continue playing musics even if you left it unattended.
//                                           It will never stop playing music every 10 seconds to wait for you to tell it to continue playing. (Won't that be annoying?)
//                                           Therefore, Youtube Music operates on Asynchronous Input mode - execution continues without commands; commands only change program behaviour.

// In our project and preparation applications, you should use Asynchronous Mode to ensure the program/game runs smoothly even without any input.
// You should **temporarily** switch to Synchronous Mode only if you need to slow down the program for debugging and behaviour examination purposes.

    // [TODO]: The most basic asynchronous input collection algorithm is:
    //   1. Check whether there is any unprocessed input character - read the lab manual and see which MacUILib function you need to use.
    //   2. If there is an input character waiting to be processed, get the character and store it as the "command"
    //      - again, read the lab manual to find out which MacUILib function you need to use.
    //   3. If there is no input character to be processed, just don't do anything and move on.
    



    // In future project preparation activities and the project itself, you may need to add more input processing logics here.
    // 
    // The guideline for adding more code is that:
    //  - If the raw input itself maps to a more specific command depending on the program logic states, you may have to 
    //    post-process the command here before sending it off to the main program logic.
    //  - We will talk about these later.

}
// MAIN LOGIC ROUTINE - "Think"
// ===============================
// The second action in our program loop is to execute the main program logic.  
// In this routine, we should determine the outcome of the logic using a) current status / state / behaviour of the program, and b) the most recent input
// The outcome of the logic then will be drawn on the screen.
//
// In later activities, we will delve deeper into this design philosophy later in the course - Finite State Machine design principle.
// 
// Let's now think about how we can complete the marquee display logic...

    // Our most basic marquee display logic for rotating a string LEFTWARD:
    //  Given an N-character string
    //  - In iteration 0, we will print the string from index 0, up to index N-1 (and heed the NULL string termination character)
    //  - In iteration 1, we will print the string from index 1, up to index N-1, THEN WRAP AROUND back to index 0 (still total of N characters printed, NULL character skipped)
    //  - In iteration 2, we will print the string from index 2, up to index N-1, then WRAP AROUND back to index 0, then stop at index 1.  (total N characters)
    //  - In iteration 3, we will print the string from index 3, up to index N-1, WRAP AROUND back to index 0, then stop at index 2.
    //  ......
    //  The name of the game is to play with the array index - track the position where you start printing, always print N characters, and make sure any index access beyond N-1
    //  ** WRAPS AROUND ** back to index 0.
    //
    //  You should recall from our lecture how to deploy index wraparound calculation.
    //
    //  You should also think about how to rotate the string RIGHTWARD.  It has something to do with how you update the printing start position.

    
    // Pseudocode for Marquee Display with Dynamically Changing String:
    // 1. Check if there was a valid input command collected
    //      1.1 if YES, perform the following
    //           1.1.a  If input command is 'ESC' (or your choice of ASCII character)
    //                  Set exitFlag to true.  Then, in the next program loop iteration, the loop will break, leading to CleanUp() routine and program shutdown.
    //           1.1.b  (Above and Beyond Feature) If input command is 'SHIFT' (or your choice of ASCII character)
    //                  Toggle the marquee rotation direction.  Think about how!
    //           1.1.c  Otherwise, the input command is just a plain character that needs to be added to the marquee display string.
    //                  Update the string contents.
    // 2. Then, update the printing start position (rightward or leftward), so that the Draw routine will be able to print the string from the correct character
    // DONE

    // [TODO]: Implement the above pseudocode logic

// DRAW ROUTINE - "Act"
// ===============================
// This routine creates the output of the program for a given iteration, using the resultant parameters from the RunLogic() routine.
// In the completed program, this should be the only routine calling the MACUILib_printf().
// If we apply the animation technique discussed in the lab document, we can then create a smooth marquee display animation on the terminal.
//
// Animation Basics (Review):
//  In every iteration
//      - Clear the screen (remove the printed contents from the previous iteration, a.k.a. previous frame)
//      - Use the calculated parameters from RunLogic(), draw line-by-line on the terminal screen to build the desired display contents for this iteration
//        (a.k.a. draw the current frame)
//
//  If we repeat the actions above at a suitable rate, the contents on the screen will look like it's moving smoothly on the screen,
//  as if we are flipping through pages of pictures.
//  - If too slow, the animation will look choppy (frame rate too low)
//  - If too fast, you won't see the animation at all (frame rate too high)

    //      - For static contents, just print them as is
    //      - For dynamic contents (namely, the marquee display portion), make sure you print the shifted string using the most updated printing start position
    //        and HEED THE WRAPAROUND.
    // [TODO]: Complete the implementation of the above pseudocode

// DELAY ROUTINE - "Wait"
// ===============================
// Sometimes referred to as the "stupidifier", this routine is only intended to slow down the program loop so that
// 1. The animation is not too fast to be appreciated
// 2. The main logic is not executed too often, such that the game won't act too ahead of the player's reaction.  Otherwise, the game will be impossible to be beaten.

// This routine is run only once at the end of the program right before shutdown, intended to clean up all the resources used by the program.
// This routine is VERY IMPORTANT to prevent memory leak.  We will cover this after the midterm.
